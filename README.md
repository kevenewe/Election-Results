# Election-Results

## Project Overview

I was asked to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election by doing the following tasks:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
3. Find the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Find the % of votes each candidate one using the formulat (votes received / total votes) *100
5. determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Summary
The assignment was complted using python, and reading the election data in and creating variable to store the results of the analysis for the data. 
This script can be used for any election by simply changing the file of election data to import. The script checks for multiple candidats and sorts the output by county and total vote in each county.  The script can show who one the overall election as well as which candidate one each of the counties. 


The analysis was then exported to the screen as well as to a text tile.
